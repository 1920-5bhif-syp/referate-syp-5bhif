## What is YouTrack?

A project management tool that can be adapted to your processes to help you deliver great products. Track tasks and bugs, plan sprints and releases, create workflows, and customize YouTrack for your business processes. Never force your process to fit the limits of a tool again. Unlike other issue trackers, YouTrack can be customized to your needs!

## YouTrack and GitHub
In this directory you have a pdf which shows you how to add GitHub to your YouTrack. The [presentation](YouTrack with GitHub integration) is from Prof. St√ºtz.
The presenation is up to date and covers all details.

## Space

The next, more advanced tool from JetBrains is Space. It's a whole lot more than YouTrack but is yet to come out.
